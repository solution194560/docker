  Use the analyze_local_image command within a container build pipeline,
  it can be used to scan multiple images that haven't been pushed to a registry yet.
  If Anchore policy evaluation gives 'fail' status, the CI job will be marked
  as a failure. A custom policy can be used for evaluation, add custom Anchore
  policy bundle to .circleci/.anchore/policy_bundle.json in your repository.
  Scanning multiple images does not support passing a dockerfile.
